# PacMen-Factory-Exercise
My task in this project was to generate a new PacMan at a random position on the screen each time the "Add PacMan" button is pressed and then to animate the PacMen on the screen by clicking on the "Start Game" button.

Open the index.html fime on a browser to launch the game.

Roadmap of future improvements: I plann on adding different shapes as well as a stop or re-start button.
